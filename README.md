Eye tracker Exercise:
Eyes and design were created using CSS. Upon sensing mouse movement, the eyes should follow mouse movement and direction using JavaScript event listeners. 

How to Run:
1. clone repo or download zipfile
2. open "index.html" in browser
3. run

Future Improvements:
1. add blinking in intervals
2. "dizzy" eye effect if mouse movement circles too quickly
3. add mobile optimization
